# Non-mac users: Paths to system header files are currently hard coded
# into clang; as a result, if clang can't find your system headers,
# please follow these instructions:
#
# touch empty.c; gcc -v empty.c -fsyntax-only
#
# to get the path.  Look for the comment "FIXME: temporary hack:
# hard-coded paths" in clang/lib/Driver/InitHeaderSearch.cpp and
# change the lines below to include that path.
