About
=====

Minitermite is a light-weight library that transforms C(++) programs
into a term-based representation of their abstract syntax trees (AST)
and vice versa.

Related work, Provenance
========================

Minitermite is a spin-off (friendly fork) of Termite [1] which is
distributed as part of the SATIrE program analysis framework [2] from
the Computer Languages group at Vienna University of Technology,
Austria.

Authors
=======

The corresponding author and maintainer is Adrian Prantl. The original
Termite was based on an earlier prototype by Christoph Bonitz and
Markus Schordan.  Gergo Barany contributed the term_lint grammar
checker, as well as support for the ICFG and other PAG-based analyses
and numerous bug fixes and improvements. Several testcases were
contributed by Viktor Pavlu. The majority of the Clang front-end
integration was contributed by Dietmar Ebner with some help from
Florian Brandner.

Installation instructions
=========================

The following commands should do the job on a UNIX-like system::

    mkdir build && cd build
    ../configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-rosedir=/opt/rose \
                 --with-boostdir=/usr --with-swi-prolog=no
    make -j<N> install
    make installcheck
